### Healthy Fact 
A small 130g Cadbury's chocolate egg contains about 537 calories. The NHS recommends a daily calorie intake limit of 2000 calories for a woman, and 2,500 for a man, so one egg is a fairly high proportion of that. The advice is therefore to eat a bit at a time! Milk chocolate eggs are often 50-60% sugar.
